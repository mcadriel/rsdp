# rsdp
A lightweight and async API service built with Rust, Actix-Web, and Tokio that reads CSV files from the command line or via file upload, transforms the data into JSON, and serves it over an HTTP endpoint.

# 📊 CSV to JSON API Service in Rust

- Read a CSV file passed via CLI and expose it as a JSON API
- Upload a CSV file via HTTP POST request
- Automatically transform CSV data into JSON format
- Serve the JSON through an HTTP API (`/data`)
